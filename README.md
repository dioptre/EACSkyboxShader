# Equi-Angular Cubemap Skybox for Unity

I wanted to play a panoramic 3D Miku video in VRChat, but the best quality
video available was in a new pixel layout, so the only option was to implement
this layout as a shader.

People might also find this useful for things like high resolution starry sky
videos.

## Copying

See `COPYING` for details on licensing. ;)

If you use this for something where it's an important core feature of
something, I wouldn't mind getting some credit. If you use it for something
cool, I might even be interested to hear about it. :)

The video linked from the sample scene was sourced from [YouTube][1].

## Known Issues

There appears to be minor alignment issue between some of the edges, but
I've checked the maths and it all seemed correct to me. So currently, I'm
not sure what the problem is. If anyone reading this has any idea...
